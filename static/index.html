  <p> There is a breed of people out there who don’t just sit on a couch all weekend but step out side with a pair of binoculars, a field guide (books are now replaced by apps), brown green dull clothes and hat. And once they step outside, they watch birds. Yes, birds. And yes, the feathered kind. 

    With more than xx species of birds around the globe that keep migrating, feeding, mating and hunting, bird-watching is an endlessly entertaining, captivating and sometimes even meditative activity. 
    
    Birders, are these people are called, have been collecting data on bird sightings across the world and for centuries. This data is priceless. It can be used to track migrations, track how bird numbers fluctuate across seasons & years. It can show us how birds are getting impacted by climate change, human projects like roads and agricultural fields. It can show how bird ranges and distributions can change over time.
     
    An enterprising group of scientists at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology started a citizen science project called eBird and they have been collecting exactly this. Data that can drive our understanding of the avian world.
